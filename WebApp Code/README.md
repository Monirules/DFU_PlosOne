This web application utilizes machine learning to detect diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) for early diagnosis and better management of the condition. The project leverages advanced techniques to analyze medical images and identify potential DFUs. In recent years, the intersection of healthcare and cutting-edge technology has paved the way for transformative advancements, offering innovative solutions to longstanding challenges. One such critical issue is the early detection and management of diabetic foot ulcers, a complication that significantly impacts the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes. In response to this pressing healthcare concern, the present project, titled "Diabetic Foot Ulcer Detection using Machine Learning," embarks on a journey to leverage the prowess of state-of-the-art technologies to revolutionize the diagnostic landscape.
